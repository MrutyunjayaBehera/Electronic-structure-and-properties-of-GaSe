     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes

     Reading data from directory:
     ./out/aiida.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = PBE ( 1  4  3  4 0 0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
